# Basic Mechanical Skills

In survival situations, having basic mechanical skills can make the difference between safety and danger. This section covers essential mechanical tasks and repair techniques for vehicles, aircraft, and boats.

## 1. Tool Familiarity and Use

### Tool Identification
- **Flat-Head Screwdriver**: For slotted screws.
- **Phillips Screwdriver**: For Phillips screws.

### Tool Maintenance
- **Cleaning**: Regularly clean tools after use.
- **Sharpening**: Sharpen blades using a consistent angle (around 20 degrees).

### Improvisation
- **Hammer Substitute**: A rock can serve as a makeshift hammer.
- **Lever Substitute**: A sturdy stick can be used as a lever.

## 2. Basic Vehicle Repairs

### Engine Troubleshooting

#### Starting Issues
- **Battery Check**: Ensure connections are tight and free of corrosion.
- **Fuel Supply**: Listen for the fuel pump when the key is in the "on" position. If silent, the pump may need attention.
- **Spark Plugs**: Inspect for wear or carbon buildup. Clean or replace as necessary.

### Tire Repairs

#### Changing a Tire
1. **Loosen Lug Nuts**: Use a lug wrench.
2. **Jack Up Vehicle**: Use the jack at the designated point.
3. **Replace Tire**: Remove the flat tire, replace it with the spare, and tighten the lug nuts in a crisscross pattern.

#### Repairing a Tire
- **Patch Kit**: Use a rasp tool to roughen the puncture area and insert a plug.
- **Tire Sealant**: Inject sealant through the valve stem and reinflate the tire.

### Overheating

#### Coolant Check
- **Cool Down**: Wait for the engine to cool before opening the radiator cap.
- **Hose Inspection**: Look for leaks or cracks and apply temporary fixes with tape if necessary.

### Brake System

#### Brake Pads
- **Inspect Pads**: Listen for squealing or grinding.
- **Replace Pads**: Remove the old pads and install new ones.

#### Brake Fluid
- **Check Levels**: Top off if braking feels spongy. Bleed the brakes if necessary.

## 3. Basic Aircraft Repairs

### Engine Issues

#### Fuel System
- **Fuel Line Check**: Inspect for blockages and clear them if found.
- **Fuel Filter**: Clean or replace if clogged.

#### Spark Plugs
- **Inspect and Clean**: Check for carbon deposits and clean or replace as needed.

### Electrical System

#### Battery and Wiring
- **Battery Check**: Ensure the battery is charged and connections are tight.
- **Wiring Inspection**: Look for loose or corroded connections.

#### Alternator
- **Test Functionality**: Check the alternator belt and replace if faulty.

### Control Surfaces

#### Inspecting and Repairing
- **Ailerons, Rudder, Elevators**: Inspect for damage. Replace frayed or broken control cables if possible.
- **Hinges and Bolts**: Tighten loose bolts and replace damaged hinges.

## 4. Basic Boat Repairs

### Hull Damage

#### Patching Holes
- **Temporary Patch**: Use duct tape, canvas, or clothing to plug holes.
- **Epoxy Repair**: Clean the area and apply marine epoxy over the breach.

#### Leak Detection
- **Check Bilge**: Inspect the bilge area for water accumulation and trace it back to its source.

### Engine Troubleshooting

#### Fuel Issues
- **Fuel Line and Filter Check**: Inspect and clear blockages. Use a water separator if water is in the fuel tank.

#### Overheating
- **Cooling System**: Clear blockages in the intake or outflow. Replace the impeller if damaged.

### Steering and Propulsion

#### Rudder Repairs
- **Inspect for Damage**: Secure the rudder temporarily with strong rope or wire.
- **Cable Tension**: Replace or tighten steering cables as needed.

#### Propeller Repair
- **Check for Debris**: Remove any tangled debris.
- **Replace Propeller**: Use a propeller puller to replace a broken blade.

### Electrical System

#### Battery and Wiring
- **Battery Maintenance**: Ensure the battery is secure and connections are corrosion-free.
- **Bilge Pump**: Check wiring and replace or repair the pump if necessary.
